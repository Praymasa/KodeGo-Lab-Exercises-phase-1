      <p>
        I am <b style="font-size: larger">Princess Ymasa</b>, 35 years of age, a
        <b>Student of Web Development</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019, amidst the global pandemic that led to widespread layoffs,
        including my own, I made a bold decision to step out of my comfort zone.
        Instead of succumbing to the challenges, I seized the opportunity to
        acquire new skills through online learning, utilizing my computer and
        the internet while still holding on to my expertise in <b>Sales</b> and
        <b>Marketing</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past three years, my professional journey has involved
        traversing
        <b>thousands of websites each month</b>, exposing me to a myriad of
        designs and functions employed for various marketing strategies.
        Intrigued by the mechanics of websites, I was inspired to delve into the
        realm of web development. Driven by a desire to showcase my
        <b>creativity</b>, I decided to build my own website as a testament to
        my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        This venture into <b>web development</b> is not merely a personal
        project; <b>it's a commitment to excellence</b>. I am eager to
        <b>leverage my skills as a Web Developer</b> to deliver client
        satisfaction in every project undertaken. The passion that fuels my
        drive for excellence makes me excited about the promising opportunities
        that await in the future.
