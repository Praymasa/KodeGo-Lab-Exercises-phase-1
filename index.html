      I am <b style="font-size: larger">Princess Ymasa</b>, 35 years of age, a
      <b>Student of Web Development</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2019, amidst the global pandemic that led to widespread layoffs,
      including my own, I made a bold decision to step out of my comfort zone.
      Instead of succumbing to the challenges, I seized the opportunity to
      acquire new skills through online learning, utilizing my computer and the
      internet while still holding on to my expertise in <b>Sales</b> and
      <b>Marketing</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past three years, my professional journey has involved traversing
      <b>thousands of websites each month</b>, exposing me to a myriad of
      designs and functions employed for various marketing strategies. Intrigued
      by the mechanics of websites, I was inspired to delve into the realm of
      web development. Driven by a desire to showcase my <b>creativity</b>, I
      decided to build my own website as a testament to my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      This venture into <b>web development</b> is not merely a personal project;
      <b>it's a commitment to excellence</b>. I am eager to
      <b>leverage my skills as a Web Developer</b> to deliver client
      satisfaction in every project undertaken. The passion that fuels my drive
      for excellence makes me excited about the promising opportunities that
      await in the future.
